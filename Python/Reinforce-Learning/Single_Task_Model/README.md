## Introduction

---

This model is based on routing, which contains routers and tasks.

[Goal] Route in best method to balance the network status.

### Algorithm

- Q-learning
- SARSA (1 direction)
- SPF Dijkstra

### Files

#### MAP_Routers.py

This file the model of the whole project. You can modify the status or network in this file.

#### Run_Model.py

This file is the start of the program. It impports 3 methods which contains in their own dirs. You can set "times of repetition" , "data size", "data length" .....
